You can feel the flavor right now at the command line. Try using more than
one terminal and start playing http pubsub:

<pre>
    # Pubs
    curl -s -v -X POST 'http://localhost/pub?id=my_channel_1' -d 'Hello World!'
    curl -s -v -X POST 'http://localhost/pub?id=your_channel_1' -d 'Hi everybody!'
    curl -s -v -X POST 'http://localhost/pub?id=your_channel_2' -d 'Goodbye!'

    # Subs
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/sub/my_channel_1.b20'
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/sub/your_channel_1.b20'
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/sub/your_channel_2.b20'

    # Channels Stats for publisher (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/pub?id=my_channel_1'

    # All Channels Stats summarized (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/channels-stats'

    # All Channels Stats detailed (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/channels-stats?id=ALL'

    # Prefixed Channels Stats detailed (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/channels-stats?id=your_channel_*'

    # Channels Stats (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/channels-stats?id=my_channel_1'

    # Delete Channels
    curl -s -v -X DELETE 'http://localhost/pub?id=my_channel_1'
</pre>


h1(#variables). Variables


h2(#push_stream_channel_id). push_stream_channel_id

*values:* _channel id_

*location:* _push_stream_publisher, push_stream_channels_statistics_

A string to uniquely identify a communication channel. Must be present on location of the push_stream_publisher and push_stream_channels_statistics.

<pre>
set $push_channel_id $arg_id;
#channel id is now the url query string parameter "id"
#(/pub?id=channel_id_string or /channels-stats?id=channel_id_string)
</pre>


h2(#push_stream_channels_path). push_stream_channels_path

*values:* _set of channels id and backtrack desired messages_

*location:* _push_stream_subscriber_

A string representing a set of channels id and backtrack desired messages separated by slash, example _/channel1.b3/channel2.b5/channel3.b2_.
The backtrack means the amount of old messages from each of the channels that will be delivered to the subscriber. On the example will be 3 messages from channel1, 5 from channel2 and 2 from channel3.
Backtrack isn't needed, you can only sign channels without get old messages, or you can mix things.
More accepted examples: _/channel1_ , _/channel1/channel2_ , _/channel1.b5/channel2_ , _/channel1/channel2.b6_ , ...
Must be present on location of the push_stream_subscriber.

<pre>
location /sub/(.*) {
  set $push_stream_channels_path $1;
}
#channels path is now part of url
#(/sub/channel_id_string or /sub/channel_id_string.b2/other_channel)
</pre>


h1(#directives). Directives


h2(#push_stream_channels_statistics). push_stream_channels_statistics

*syntax:* _push_stream_channels_statistics_

*context:* _location_

*release version:* _0.2.0_

Defines a location as a source of statistics. You can use this location to get statistics about a specific, group or all channels, in a resumed ou summarized way.
To get statistics about all channels in a summarized way you have to make a GET in this location without specify a name in the push_stream_channel_id variable.
To get statistics about all channels in a detailed way you have to specify "ALL" in the push_stream_channel_id.
To get statistics about prefixed channels in a detailed way you have to specify "_prefix_*" in the push_stream_channel_id.
To get statistics about a channel you have to specify the name in the push_stream_channel_id.

You can get statistics in the formats plain, xml, yaml and json. The default is json, to change this behavior you can use *Accept* header parameter passing values like "text/plain", "application/xml", "application/yaml" and "application/json" respectivelly.

<pre>
  location /channels-stats {
      push_stream_channels_statistics;
      set $push_stream_channel_id             $arg_id;
  }

  # /channels-stats -> get statistics about all channels in a summarized way
  # /channels-stats?id=ALL -> get statistics about all channels in a detailed way
  # /channels-stats?id=channel_* -> get statistics about all channels which starts with 'channel_'
  # /channels-stats?id=channel_id -> get statistics about a channel
</pre>


h2(#push_stream_publisher). push_stream_publisher

*syntax:* _push_stream_publisher [normal | admin]_

*default:* _normal_

*context:* _location_

Defines a location as a message publisher. Requests to a publisher location are treated as messages to be sent to subscribers.
This location supports three http methods:
GET, make possible to get statistics about the channel
POST, publish a message to the channel
DELETE, remove any existent stored messages, disconnect any subscriber, and delete the channel. Available only if _admin_ value is used in this directive.

<pre>
  # normal publisher location
  location /pub {
      push_stream_publisher;
      set $push_stream_channel_id             $arg_id;
  }

  # GET    /pub?id=channel_id -> get statistics about a channel
  # POST   /pub?id=channel_id -> publish a message to the channel

  # admin publisher location
  location /pub_admin {
      push_stream_publisher                   admin;
      set $push_stream_channel_id             $arg_id;
  }

  # GET    /pub_admin?id=channel_id -> get statistics about a channel
  # POST   /pub_admin?id=channel_id -> publish a message to the channel
  # DELETE /pub_admin?id=channel_id -> delete the channel
</pre>


h2(#push_stream_subscriber). push_stream_subscriber

*syntax:* _push_stream_subscriber [streaming | polling | long-polling]_

*default:* _streaming_

*context:* _location_

Defines a location as a subscriber. This location represents a subscriber's interface to a channel's message queue.
This location only supports GET http method to receive published messages.
And has three possible values to set push mode: streaming, polling, long-polling. The default values is streaming.
The polling and long-polling modes could be set by the request header *X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode* overriding push_stream_subscriber directive value.

<pre>
  # streaming subscriber location
  location /sub/(.*) {
      push_stream_subscriber;
      # positional channel path
      set $push_stream_channels_path              $1;
  }

  curl localhost/sub/ch1 -H 'X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode:polling'      #polling request on a streaming location
  curl localhost/sub/ch1 -H 'X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode:long-polling' #long-polling request on a streaming location

  # polling subscriber location
  location /sub/(.*) {
      push_stream_subscriber                      polling;
      # positional channel path
      set $push_stream_channels_path              $1;
  }

  curl localhost/sub/ch1                                           #polling request
  curl localhost/sub/ch1 -H 'X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode:long-polling' #long-polling request on a polling location

  # long polling subscriber location
  location /sub/(.*) {
      push_stream_subscriber                      long-polling;
      # positional channel path
      set $push_stream_channels_path              $1;
  }

  curl localhost/sub/ch1                                           #long-polling request
  curl localhost/sub/ch1 -H 'X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode:polling'      #polling request on a logn-polling location
</pre>

h1(#attention). Attention

This module controls everything needed to send the messages to subscribers.
So it disable Nginx's chuncked filter to reduce memory consumption in streaming connections.


h1(#tests). Tests

The tests for this module are written in Ruby, and are acceptance tests.
To run them is needed to have an environment with:

* Basic requirements
** ruby >= 1.8.7
** rubygems >= 1.6.2
** rake >= 0.8.7
* Required gems
** POpen4 >= 0.1.4
** em-http-request >= 0.2.14
** json >= 1.4.3
** ruby-debug >= 0.10.4
** jasmine >= 1.0.2.1
** nokogiri >= 1.5.0

You can install these gems with bundler (bundler is required to be installed before, _gem install bundler_)

<pre>
cd test/
bundle install --without docs
</pre>

or individually

<pre>
gem install POpen4 -v 0.1.4
gem install em-http-request -v 0.2.14
gem install json -v 1.4.3
gem install ruby-debug -v 0.10.4
gem install jasmine -v 1.0.2.1
gem install nokogiri -v 1.5.0
</pre>

Then issue @rake tests@.
This command run the tests using nginx *executable* located at _/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx_ with _1_ *worker* responding at *host* _localhost_ and *port* _9990_.
To change this behavior use the commands bellow

<pre>
rake tests executable="../build/nginx-1.0.5/objs/nginx"   # to change default path for nginx executable
rake tests host=my_machine                                # to change default hostname
rake tests port=9889                                      # to change default port
rake tests workers=2                                      # to change dafault number of workers used

and can combine any of these parameters, like:

rake tests port=9889 executable="../build/nginx-1.0.5/objs/nginx"
</pre>
