h2(#basic-usage). Basic Usage

You can feel the flavor right now at the command line. Try using more than
one terminal and start playing http pubsub:

<pre>
<code>
    # Pubs
    curl -s -v -X POST 'http://localhost/pub?id=my_channel_1' -d 'Hello World!'
    curl -s -v -X POST 'http://localhost/pub?id=your_channel_1' -d 'Hi everybody!'
    curl -s -v -X POST 'http://localhost/pub?id=your_channel_2' -d 'Goodbye!'

    # Subs
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/sub/my_channel_1.b20'
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/sub/your_channel_1.b20'
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/sub/your_channel_2.b20'

    # Channels Stats for publisher (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/pub?id=my_channel_1'

    # All Channels Stats summarized (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/channels-stats'

    # All Channels Stats detailed (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/channels-stats?id=ALL'

    # Prefixed Channels Stats detailed (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/channels-stats?id=your_channel_*'

    # Channels Stats (json format)
    curl -s -v 'http://localhost/channels-stats?id=my_channel_1'

    # Delete Channels
    curl -s -v -X DELETE 'http://localhost/pub?id=my_channel_1'

h4(#push_stream_channel_id). push_stream_channel_id

A string to uniquely identify a communication channel. Must be present on location of the push_stream_publisher and push_stream_channels_statistics.

<pre>
<code>
set $push_channel_id $arg_id;
#channel id is now the url query string parameter "id"
#(/pub?id=channel_id_string or /channels-stats?id=channel_id_string)
</code>
</pre>

h4(#push_stream_channels_path). push_stream_channels_path

A string representing a set of channels id and backtrack desired messages separated by slash, example _/channel1.b3/channel2.b5/channel3.b2_.
The backtrack means the amount of old messages from each of the channels that will be delivered to the subscriber. On the example will be 3 messages from channel1, 5 from channel2 and 2 from channel3.
Backtrack isn't needed, you can only sign channels without get old messages, or you can mix things.
More accepted examples: _/channel1_ , _/channel1/channel2_ , _/channel1.b5/channel2_ , _/channel1/channel2.b6_ , ...
Must be present on location of the push_stream_subscriber.

<pre>
<code>
location /sub/(.*) {
  set $push_stream_channels_path $1;
}
#channels path is now part of url
#(/sub/channel_id_string or /sub/channel_id_string.b2/other_channel)

h3(#location_handlers). Location Handlers

h4(#push_stream_channels_statistics). push_stream_channels_statistics

New in version 0.2.0
context: location

Defines a location as a source of statistics. You can use this location to get statistics about a specific, group or all channels, in a resumed ou summarized way.
To get statistics about all channels in a summarized way you have to make a GET in this location without specify a name in the push_stream_channel_id variable.
To get statistics about all channels in a detailed way you have to specify "ALL" in the push_stream_channel_id.
To get statistics about prefixed channels in a detailed way you have to specify "_prefix_*" in the push_stream_channel_id.
To get statistics about a channel you have to specify the name in the push_stream_channel_id.

You can get statistics in the formats plain, xml, yaml and json. The default is json, to change this behavior you can use *Accept* header parameter passing values like "text/plain", "application/xml", "application/yaml" and "application/json" respectivelly.

<pre>
<code>
  location /channels-stats {
      push_stream_channels_statistics;
      set $push_stream_channel_id             $arg_id;
  }

  # /channels-stats -> get statistics about all channels in a summarized way
  # /channels-stats?id=ALL -> get statistics about all channels in a detailed way
  # /channels-stats?id=channel_* -> get statistics about all channels which starts with 'channel_'
  # /channels-stats?id=channel_id -> get statistics about a channel
</code>
</pre>

h4(#push_stream_publisher). push_stream_publisher

default: normal
context: location
values: normal, admin

Defines a location as a message publisher. Requests to a publisher location are treated as messages to be sent to subscribers.
This location supports three http methods:
GET, make possible to get statistics about the channel
POST, publish a message to the channel
DELETE, remove any existent stored messages, disconnect any subscriber, and delete the channel. Available only if _admin_ value is used in this directive.

<pre>
<code>
  # normal publisher location
  location /pub {
      push_stream_publisher;
      set $push_stream_channel_id             $arg_id;
  }

  # GET    /pub?id=channel_id -> get statistics about a channel
  # POST   /pub?id=channel_id -> publish a message to the channel

  # admin publisher location
  location /pub_admin {
      push_stream_publisher                   admin;
      set $push_stream_channel_id             $arg_id;
  }

  # GET    /pub_admin?id=channel_id -> get statistics about a channel
  # POST   /pub_admin?id=channel_id -> publish a message to the channel
  # DELETE /pub_admin?id=channel_id -> delete the channel
</code>
</pre>

h4(#push_stream_subscriber). push_stream_subscriber

default: streaming
context: location
values: streaming, polling, long-polling

Defines a location as a subscriber. This location represents a subscriber's interface to a channel's message queue.
This location only supports GET http method to receive published messages.
And has three possible values to set push mode: streaming, polling, long-polling. The default values is streaming.
The polling and long-polling modes could be set by the request header *X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode* overriding push_stream_subscriber directive value.

<pre>
<code>
  # streaming subscriber location
  location /sub/(.*) {
      push_stream_subscriber;
      # positional channel path
      set $push_stream_channels_path              $1;
  }

  curl localhost/sub/ch1 -H 'X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode:polling'      #polling request on a streaming location
  curl localhost/sub/ch1 -H 'X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode:long-polling' #long-polling request on a streaming location

  # polling subscriber location
  location /sub/(.*) {
      push_stream_subscriber                      polling;
      # positional channel path
      set $push_stream_channels_path              $1;
  }

  curl localhost/sub/ch1                                           #polling request
  curl localhost/sub/ch1 -H 'X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode:long-polling' #long-polling request on a polling location

  # long polling subscriber location
  location /sub/(.*) {
      push_stream_subscriber                      long-polling;
      # positional channel path
      set $push_stream_channels_path              $1;
  }

  curl localhost/sub/ch1                                           #long-polling request
  curl localhost/sub/ch1 -H 'X-Nginx-PushStream-Mode:polling'      #polling request on a logn-polling location
</code>
</pre>

h4(#push_stream_shared_memory_size). push_stream_shared_memory_size [ size ]

default: 32M

When this memory is full any new request for publish a message or subscribe a channel will receive an 500 Internal Server Error response.

h4(#push_stream_shared_memory_cleanup_objects_ttl). push_stream_shared_memory_cleanup_objects_ttl [ time ]

default: 30 seconds
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

The length of time a message or a channel will stay on garbage collection area before it is completly discarded, freeing the shared memory. The minimum length is 30 seconds to ensure that no one is using these elements.
This operation is very important to help Nginx recycle memory consumed to create messages and channels, so do not use a large time.

h4(#push_stream_channel_deleted_message_text). push_stream_channel_deleted_message_text [ string ]

New in version 0.2.5
default: "Channel deleted"
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

h4(#push_stream_max_subscribers_per_channel). push_stream_max_subscribers_per_channel [ number ]

default: -
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

The maximum number of subscribers accepted per channel. If you do not want to limit number of subscribers access to channels, just not set this directive.

h4(#push_stream_max_messages_stored_per_channel). push_stream_max_messages_stored_per_channel [ number ]

default: -
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

The maximum number of messages to store per channel. A channel's message buffer will retain at most this many most recent messages. If you do not want messages to be discarded by length, just not set this directive.

h4(#push_stream_max_channel_id_length). push_stream_max_channel_id_length [ number ]

default: -
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

Maximum permissible channel id length (number of characters). Longer ids will receive an 400 Bad Request response. If you do not want to limit channel id length, just not set this directive.

h4(#push_stream_ping_message_interval). push_stream_ping_message_interval [ time ]

default: -
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

The time interval in which a keepalive message is sent to subscribers. If you do not want to send ping messages, just not set this directive.

h4(#push_stream_subscriber_connection_ttl). push_stream_subscriber_connection_ttl [ time ]

default: -
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

The length of time a subscriber will stay connected before it is considered expired and disconnected. If you do not want subscribers to be automatically disconnected, just not set this directive.
But, this operation is very important to help Nginx recycle memory consumed to send messages to susbscriber, allocated at pool request.

h4(#push_stream_max_number_of_channels). push_stream_max_number_of_channels [ number ]

default: -
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

The maximum number of concurrent channels on the server. If you do not want to limit the number of channels, just not set this directive.

default: -
context: http
location: main nginx configuration

The string prefix used to identify when a channel is a normal or broadcast channel, example: when you set this directive as "bd_", "bd_ch1" will be a broadcast channel

h4(#push_stream_store_messages). push_stream_store_messages [ on | off ]

default: off

If set to on, a publisher must send a POST request before a subscriber can request messages on the channel. Otherwise, all subscriber requests to nonexistent channels will get a 403 Forbidden response.
This restriction is not applied to broadcast channels, but to subscribe to a broadcast channel is necessary to subscribe at least to one normal channel, and if this directive is set to on this channel has to be created before.

h4(#push_stream_header_template). push_stream_header_template [ string ]

default: -
context: location
location: push_stream_subscriber

The text that will be sended to subscribers when they arrive.

h4(#push_stream_message_template). push_stream_message_template [ string ]

h2(#attention). Attention

This module controls everything needed to send the messages to subscribers.
So it disable Nginx's chuncked filter to reduce memory consumption in streaming connections.

h2(#tests). Tests

The tests for this module are written in Ruby, and are acceptance tests.
To run them is needed to have an environment with:

* Basic requirements
** ruby >= 1.8.7
** rubygems >= 1.6.2
** rake >= 0.8.7
* Required gems
** POpen4 >= 0.1.4
** em-http-request >= 0.2.14
** json >= 1.4.3
** ruby-debug >= 0.10.4
** jasmine >= 1.0.2.1

You can install these gems with bundler (bundler is required to be installed before, _gem install bundler_)

<pre>
<code>
cd test/
bundle install --without docs
</code>
</pre>

or individually

<pre>
<code>
gem install POpen4 -v 0.1.4
gem install em-http-request -v 0.2.14
gem install json -v 1.4.3
gem install ruby-debug -v 0.10.4
gem install jasmine -v 1.0.2.1
</code>
</pre>

Then issue @rake tests@.
This command run the tests using nginx *executable* located at _/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx_ with _1_ *worker* responding at *host* _localhost_ and *port* _9990_.
To change this behavior use the commands bellow

<pre>
<code>
rake tests executable="../build/nginx-1.0.5/objs/nginx"   # to change default path for nginx executable
rake tests host=my_machine                                # to change default hostname
rake tests port=9889                                      # to change default port
rake tests workers=2                                      # to change dafault number of workers used

and can combine any of these parameters, like:

rake tests port=9889 executable="../build/nginx-1.0.5/objs/nginx"
</code>
